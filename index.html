  <h2>Quote number 1</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Brethren, none of us likes to admit when we are drifting off the right course. Often we try to avoid looking deeply into our souls and confronting our weaknesses, limitations, and fears. Consequently, when we do examine our lives, we look through the filter of biases, excuses, and stories we tell ourselves in order to justify unworthy thoughts and actions.</p>
    <p>But being able to see ourselves clearly is essential to our spiritual growth and well-being. If our weaknesses and shortcomings remain obscured in the shadows, then the redeeming power of the Savior cannot heal them and make them strengths.12 Ironically, our blindness toward our human weaknesses will also make us blind to the divine potential that our Father yearns to nurture within each of us."</p>

  <h2>Quote number 2</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The sacrament is a beautiful and significant ordinance. It reminds us of our covenants and commitments to the Savior. It helps us to remember Him and His Atonement. It provides an opportunity to repent, to renew, and to rededicate ourselves to follow His teachings. As we partake of the sacrament, we can receive forgiveness, find spiritual healing, and strengthen our faith. The sacrament is a powerful ritual that invites the Holy Spirit into our lives, helps us to overcome weaknesses, and enables us to progress in our discipleship. It is a weekly reminder of the Savior's love, grace, and mercy. It is a sacred moment to reflect, to renew our determination, and to receive divine assistance in our quest to become more like Him."</p>
